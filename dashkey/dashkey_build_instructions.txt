1. Grab a copy of WinAVR:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/
And install it.

2. Grab a copy of the eclipse IDE (you should get the C/C++ edition if you want minimum grief):
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Or set up another development environment of your choice

3. Get the latest avr-eclipse:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/avr-eclipse/files/avr-eclipse%20beta%20versions/
And add it to your eclipse installation. A helpful guide can be found here:
http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Plugin_Download

4. Grab the latest build of LUFA:
http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php (2013-03-03 as of this writing)
And extract it to a folder.

5. Grab the latest build of dashkey out of the openclack github: (if you don't have it already)
https://github.com/toastfox/openclack

6. Open the dashkey project in eclipse

7. Edit the makefile to provide a valid LUFA_PATH. While you're in here, be sure to set valid MCU, F_CPU, etc.. values

8. Because eclipse sucks, you'll need to ignore a couple of their code analysis tools. To do so, open the project properties, go to "C/C++ General" then "Code Analysis". Set the radio button to "Use project settings", then uncheck "Symbol is not resolved", "Type cannot be resolved" and "Field cannot be resolved" down at the bottom

7. Attempt to build, cry if it fails, fix errors

8. Assuming no errors, grab the resulting dashkey.hex and flash it to your keyboard controller

9. Optionally, generate an eeprom file and flash that too (if you want a custom keyboard map)
